## How do they differ on type of bike ridden?

Casuals are more likely to choose a docked bike and less likely to
choose a classic bike.

## Do they differ in *what hour* rides are taken?

There seems to be a slight tendency for casuals to start their rides
later. The tendency is similar for ending times (not shown.)

## Are some stations preferred by casuals?

Dramatically so! Some stations are 100% casual use and others are
near-zero! The median station is 42% casual use.
