This case study explores a real-world public dataset from *Divvy*, a
bike-sharing company run cooperatively between the City of Chicago and
Motivate International Inc. The system provides bicycles in a city-wide
network of docking stations which can be accessed by annual members or
casual users who purchase a single-ride or day pass. Over four
million rides were taken between June 2020 and July 2021.

This case study will explore the differences between members & casual
users, along with patterns of overall system use, particularly traffic volume and flow.
The R programming language has been used for the entire analysis.
