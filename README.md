This case study explores a real-world public dataset from *Divvy*, a
bike-sharing company run cooperatively between the City of Chicago and
Motivate International Inc.Â The system provides bicycles in a city-wide
network of docking stations which can be accessed by annual members or
casual users who purchase a single-ride or day pass. Well over four
million rides have been taken on the system between June 2020 and July
2021.

This case study will explore the difference between members & casual
users, and patterns of overall system use, particularly traffic volume
and flow.
